## Documentation Index

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [react-frontend/CLAUDE.md](react-frontend/CLAUDE.md) | React frontend stack conventions, contexts, hooks, pages |
| [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) | Public documentation index and publication standards |
| [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | Maintained platform architecture map and major runtime boundaries |
| [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) | Deployment guide (public-safe; secrets stay in local env files) |
| [docs/REACT-DUAL-BACKEND.md](docs/REACT-DUAL-BACKEND.md) | React dual-backend guardrails: Laravel production/default, ASP.NET development-only until contract-compatible |
| [docs/govuk-alpha/RESEARCH.md](docs/govuk-alpha/RESEARCH.md) | GOV.UK-based accessible frontend architecture, official repos, licensing, and branding limits |
| [LARAVEL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](LARAVEL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) | Historical Laravel migration record and current backend migration guidance |
| `BACKUP.md` (local-only, gitignored) | Full backup system and private backup-remote workflow for machine transfers |

> Note: `docs/` is public documentation. Local prompts, scratch reports, handoffs, and stale generated artifacts belong in `.local-docs-archive/`, which is gitignored. PHP_CONVENTIONS / API_REFERENCE / REGRESSION_PREVENTION / QA_AUDIT_AND_TEST_PLAN / LOCAL_DEV_SETUP have been retired — follow existing code patterns in `app/Services/` and `routes/api.php` instead.

### Documentation Hygiene

`docs/` must stay small, public-safe, and maintained. Do not write routine prompts, plans, handoffs, audit dumps, generated reports, exported PDFs, screenshots, or scratch notes into `docs/`, including `docs/superpowers/plans/`. Put local task output in `.local-docs-archive/` instead.

Every public doc must be Markdown, linked from [docs/README.md](docs/README.md), and pass:

```bash
npm run check:docs
```

### Version and Changelog Hygiene

`VERSION` is the canonical platform semantic version. Keep it in sync with `composer.json`, `react-frontend/package.json`, `config/app.php`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `react-frontend/src/config/releaseStatus.ts`, and current public collateral. Verify with:

```bash
npm run check:version
```

For every release-relevant change (code, config, scripts, CI, public docs, user-visible behaviour, or release/version metadata), update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under `[Unreleased]` before finishing. Then refresh the in-app bundled copy:

```bash
npm --prefix react-frontend run copy-changelog
```

If a change genuinely needs no release note, state that explicitly in the final response. Do not silently skip the changelog.

## Local Development (Docker-First)

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| **React Frontend** | http://127.0.0.1:5173 |
| **PHP API** | http://127.0.0.1:8090 |
| **React Admin** | http://127.0.0.1:5173/admin |
| **Docker DB** | 127.0.0.1:3307 -> MariaDB 3306 |
| **Docker Redis** | 127.0.0.1:6379 |
| **Meilisearch** | http://127.0.0.1:7700 |

```bash
npm run dev:docker      # Start Docker PHP, database, Redis, Meilisearch, and native Vite
npm run dev:frontend    # Start only native Vite on http://127.0.0.1:5173
npm run dev:accessible-frontend  # Start accessible frontend dev server
```

**Important:** Project NEXUS is Docker-first for local development. The Laravel/PHP API runs in the Docker PHP app on `127.0.0.1:8090`; MariaDB, Redis, and Meilisearch run from the same Compose stack. The default frontend workflow uses native Vite on Windows for fast HMR, proxying `/api` to the Docker PHP app. Use the Docker frontend profile only when deliberately testing the frontend container.

Docker queue, sales, and frontend are opt-in profiles:

```bash
docker compose --profile docker-php up -d app
docker compose --profile docker-frontend up -d frontend
```

### WebAuthn / Passkeys — Windows Dev Environment

**RP ID:** `project-nexus.ie` (covers `app.project-nexus.ie`, `api.project-nexus.ie`, and `accessible.project-nexus.ie`)
- Production/Azure: set `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID=project-nexus.ie` in `.env`
- Local dev: set `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID=localhost`
- Production Docker env (`compose.prod.yml`) derives it correctly from HTTP_ORIGIN fallback

**Windows Hello requirement:** Chrome uses the native Windows WebAuthn API which requires `WbioSrvc` (Windows Biometric Service) to be **running** at the moment the passkey dialog opens. This service idles down and stops automatically — if it's stopped, Chrome's "Choose a passkey" dialog will show NO "This Windows device" / Windows Hello option.

**Fix:** Run `scripts/setup-wbio-keepalive.ps1` once as Administrator on your dev machine. This sets service auto-recovery and a scheduled task to restart WbioSrvc every 5 minutes.
- Manual restart: `Start-Service WbioSrvc` in PowerShell
- Check status: `(Get-Service WbioSrvc).Status`

**If "This Windows device" never appears in Chrome's passkey dialog:**
The NGC folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Ngc`) must exist — this is where Windows Hello credentials are stored. If it doesn't exist, Windows Hello is NOT enrolled and Chrome has no platform authenticator to offer.
- Diagnostic: `Test-Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Ngc"` — must be `True`
- Fix: Open Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options > PIN (Windows Hello) and set it up. A regular Windows sign-in PIN is NOT the same as Windows Hello PIN and does NOT support WebAuthn.
- WbioSrvc stops immediately when no biometric hardware and no NGC credentials exist — this is a symptom of the above, not the cause.

**Key files:**
- `react-frontend/src/lib/webauthn.ts` — all WebAuthn frontend logic (SimpleWebAuthn wrapper)
- `react-frontend/src/components/security/BiometricSettings.tsx` — passkey settings UI
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/WebAuthnController.php` — registration/auth endpoints
- `app/Services/WebAuthnChallengeStore.php` — Redis/file challenge storage

## LARAVEL MIGRATION — STATUS

The Laravel migration has been **merged to `main`** (2026-03-19) and is live in production. The `laravel-migration` branch no longer exists.

- **Phases 0–5 are complete**: Laravel 12.54 is the sole HTTP handler, routing, middleware, controllers, and auth
- **All 223 services are native Laravel implementations** — zero stubs remain (47 converted + 45 dead stubs deleted on 2026-03-21)
- **Legacy top-level `src/` directory has been fully removed** — all PHP now lives in `app/` (PSR-4 `App\`); there is no longer a `Nexus\` autoload namespace. `app/Core/ImageUploader.php` is the last remaining legacy-style helper.
- **5 Event Listeners** in `app/Listeners/` are fully implemented (completed 2026-03-21)
- All new schema changes use Laravel migrations in `database/migrations/` (5 Laravel, 190 legacy SQL)
- See [LARAVEL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](LARAVEL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) for the historical migration record and current schema-migration guidance.

## MANDATORY RULES

### 🔴 PRIORITIZE PUBLIC REPOSITORIES & SHARED COMPONENTS

When upgrading this platform, ALWAYS look through public repositories for the best available shared components before writing custom code. **Your 1st priority must ALWAYS be using HeroUI and Tailwind CSS shared components.** It is highly preferable to use established, working components rather than building custom variations from scratch.

---

### 🔴 NO HARDCODED STRINGS — ALL USER-FACING TEXT MUST USE TRANSLATIONS (CRITICAL)

**NEVER write hardcoded English strings in email templates or end-user React frontend output.** This has regressed repeatedly — every new feature ships with inline English, making the platform untranslatable.

**Rules:**
- **PHP emails/services:** Every user-facing string MUST use `__('emails.section.key')` with keys in `lang/en/emails.json`
- **React frontend (end-user UI):** Every label MUST use `t('key')` with keys in the appropriate namespace — applies to everything under `react-frontend/src/pages/`, `src/components/`, etc.
- **When adding a new email:** Add ALL translation keys to `lang/en/emails.json` FIRST, then reference them with `__()`

**What counts as hardcoded:** Subject lines, greetings ("Hi {name},"), button text ("View Profile"), footer text ("All rights reserved"), info card labels, body paragraphs, notice text, page titles. All of these must be translated — in emails, React frontend, and the admin panel.

**CI enforcement:** `scripts/check-i18n.sh` runs in pre-push and CI.

---

### 🔴 EMAIL & NOTIFICATION LOCALE — MUST WRAP IN LocaleContext (CRITICAL)

Every user-facing `__('emails...')`, `__('notifications...')`, or `__('svc_notifications...')` call MUST render in the **recipient's** `preferred_language` — not the HTTP caller's locale, not the queue worker's default, not `config('app.locale')`. Without the wrap, Laravel's `__()` resolves against `App::getLocale()` at call time, so emails dispatched from cron/queues go out in English regardless of what the recipient chose.

**Rules:**
- Every service/listener/job that renders a notification MUST wrap the render + send block in `App\I18n\LocaleContext::withLocale($recipient, fn () => {...})`
- Every user SELECT / eager-load feeding a notification MUST include `preferred_language` (or use `User::findByIdSelectColumns`, which already returns it)
- **Admin fanouts / attendee loops:** wrap INSIDE the per-recipient loop — the subject line must also render in each admin's language, not just the body
- **Queue jobs:** pass `preferred_language` into the job payload and wrap the `handle()` body — queue workers boot once with a default locale and never change it otherwise
- `LocaleContext::withLocale()` accepts a string locale code, a User-like object with `->preferred_language`, or null (no-op). It restores the prior locale in a `finally` block, so exceptions can't leak the switched locale

**Before (leaks caller locale to recipient):**
```php
foreach ($admins as $admin) {
    $subject = __('emails.report.subject'); // renders in caller's locale
    $mailer->send($admin->email, $subject, $body);
}
```

**After (renders in each admin's `preferred_language`):**
```php
use App\I18n\LocaleContext;

foreach ($admins as $admin) {
    LocaleContext::withLocale($admin, function () use ($admin, $mailer, $body) {
        $subject = __('emails.report.subject');
        $mailer->send($admin->email, $subject, $body);
    });
}
```

Regression test: `tests/Laravel/Feature/I18n/EmailLocaleIntegrationTest.php`.

---

### 🔴 GLOBAL PLATFORM — NO LOCALE-SPECIFIC VALIDATION (CRITICAL)

Project NEXUS is a **global platform** serving timebanks worldwide. It is NOT an Irish-only product.

- **NEVER use `Validator::isIrishPhone()`** — use `Validator::isPhone()` for international E.164 format
- **NEVER validate phone numbers against Irish patterns** (no `+353`, `08x`, `00353` checks)
- **NEVER add Irish-specific placeholders** in forms — use neutral international examples like `+1 555 123 4567`
- **NEVER hardcode Ireland/Dublin as a default location** — maps default to a neutral global center
- **No locale-specific location validation** — `validateIrishLocation()` is legacy, do not call it
- The `isIrishPhone()` method in `Validator.php` is **kept only for legacy PHP admin views** — do not use it anywhere else

---

### 🔴 OPEN SOURCE — AGPL-3.0 (CRITICAL)

This project is **publicly released** under AGPL-3.0-or-later at <https://github.com/jasperfordesq-ai/nexus-v1>.

- **Every new source file** (PHP, TS, TSX) MUST have this SPDX header:

  ```text
  // Copyright © 2024–2026 Jasper Ford
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
  // Author: Jasper Ford
  // See NOTICE file for attribution and acknowledgements.
  ```

  PHP: after `<?php`. TS/TSX: first lines. Run `node scripts/add-spdx-headers.mjs` to batch-add, `node scripts/check-spdx.mjs` to verify.

- **Attribution on every page** — Footer, mobile drawer, auth pages must show AGPL Section 7(b) attribution. Do NOT remove.
- **About page contributors** from `react-frontend/src/data/contributors.json` — rendered programmatically, never hardcoded.
- **NOTICE file** contains authoritative legal terms (Section 7 a–f). Do NOT modify without understanding implications.
- **Never commit secrets** — `.gitignore` protects `.env`, uploads, vendor. The repo is PUBLIC.

---

### 🔴 LEGACY PHP THEMES ARE DEAD — NEVER TOUCH (CRITICAL)

**ALL `views/` content is DEAD legacy code.** `/admin-legacy/` and `/super-admin/` have been decommissioned. Do NOT spend any time or credits on any PHP views. Ever.

- **NEVER modify, fix, refactor, or audit** any PHP view files under `views/` (including `views/admin/`, `views/modern/admin/`, `views/civicone/`, `views/starter/`, etc.)
- **NEVER create hooks, checks, or CI gates** that reference legacy views
- **NEVER suggest improvements** to any legacy PHP view code
- All user-facing UI is React. Period.
- **⚠️ Two live exceptions (do NOT delete):** `views/emails/match_{hot,mutual,digest}.php` are still rendered by `app/Services/NotificationDispatcher.php` (each with an inline HTML fallback), and `views/errors/404.php` by `app/Middleware/TenantModuleMiddleware.php`. Deleting these silently changes match-notification emails / the module-404 page. To fully retire `views/`, migrate these into the Laravel mail/view layer first.

---

### 🔴 REACT FRONTEND IS THE PRIMARY UI (CRITICAL)

**The React frontend (`react-frontend/`) is the sole frontend for all pages.** There are no maintained PHP views.

- **ALL UI work** goes in `react-frontend/`
- **UI stack**: React 19 + TypeScript + **HeroUI v3** (`@heroui/react`) + **Tailwind CSS 4**. The v3 package migration is complete (no v2 npm alias). Framer Motion has been removed — animations use the local `@/lib/motion` shim (CSS-transition-backed) or Tailwind/CSS. Do NOT reintroduce `framer-motion`.
- **Icons**: Lucide React (`lucide-react`)
- Use HeroUI components as primary building blocks
- Use Tailwind CSS utilities for layout/spacing — **no separate CSS component files**
- Use CSS tokens in `src/styles/tokens.css` for theme-aware colors
- **Do NOT** create PHP views

- **Laravel is the production/default backend contract.** ASP.NET compatibility work is development-only and must make ASP.NET conform to the Laravel React API rather than changing production frontend behaviour; see [docs/REACT-DUAL-BACKEND.md](docs/REACT-DUAL-BACKEND.md).

See [react-frontend/CLAUDE.md](react-frontend/CLAUDE.md) for full styling rules, contexts, hooks, and component reference.

### Accessible Frontend (GOV.UK-Based)

The accessible frontend is an explicitly approved UI track that complements, but does not replace, `react-frontend/`. It is the only maintained exception to the React-primary UI rule and is intended for users who benefit from a highly accessible, HTML-first experience. The public-facing track is now Beta; the `GovukAlpha`, `govuk_alpha`, and `/alpha/...` names remain as compatibility code-path names until a deliberate route/namespace migration is done.

- Keep it isolated under root-level `accessible-frontend/`, `app/Http/Controllers/GovukAlpha/`, and `/{tenantSlug}/alpha/...` routes.
- Preferred public subdomain: `accessible.project-nexus.ie`.
- Deploy it through the Laravel/PHP blue-green app container, not the React container. Run `npm run build:accessible-frontend`, `npm run test:accessible-frontend:php`, and `npm run test:accessible-frontend:a11y` before deployment.
- Use official `govuk-frontend` first. The project currently installs `govuk-frontend@6.1.0`; npm latest stable was verified as `6.3.0` on 2026-06-23 and should be upgraded only after a compatibility pass.
- Use official GOV.UK Frontend markup/classes/Sass/JS with HTML-first progressive enhancement; do not use unofficial React GOV.UK libraries as the foundation.
- Do not use the GOV.UK crown, GOV.UK logotype, GOV.UK header identity, GDS Transport, or wording that implies this is an official UK government service.
- Do not use deprecated GOV.UK repos/packages: `govuk_template`, `govuk_elements`, or `govuk_frontend_toolkit`.
- All user-facing strings must use `lang/en/govuk_alpha.php`.
- Preserve tenant context, module gates, and AGPL Section 7(b) attribution on every accessible frontend page.

See [docs/govuk-alpha/RESEARCH.md](docs/govuk-alpha/RESEARCH.md) for the architecture decision and source list.

---

### 🔴 NEVER AUTO-DEPLOY (CRITICAL)

**NEVER start a deployment unless the user explicitly tells you to deploy.** Completing a task (code changes, bug fix, feature implementation, audit fix, etc.) does NOT imply "deploy it." Always stop after committing/pushing and wait for the user to give a direct deployment instruction.

No agent may initiate SSH, run `bluegreen-deploy.sh` / `safe-deploy.sh`, or trigger any production deployment autonomously.

---

### 🔴 NEVER AUTO-PUSH TO BACKUP REPO (CRITICAL)

**NEVER push to the `backup` remote (`nexus-v1-backup`) unless the user explicitly tells you to.** The backup repo is private and contains credentials, secrets, and all gitignored files.

See local-only `BACKUP.md` for the full backup system documentation.

---

## General Principles

- **Do NOT default to the quickest solution** — prioritize maintainability
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Ask if unsure about where code should live
- **Don't hallucinate fixes** — never claim you've fixed something you haven't actually edited
- **Don't go in circles when debugging** — if an approach fails twice, stop and reassess the root cause
- **Verify before claiming complete** — after deploying a fix, verify it actually resolved the issue

---

## HeroUI Migration Workflow

For any HeroUI v2/v3 migration, component API question, or related React code change, check the official HeroUI v3 docs before giving migration advice or editing components.

- Prefer official HeroUI v3 migration docs over memory, especially for `Select`, `Dropdown`, `Accordion`, `Progress`, `DateInput`, `TimeInput`, modals, hooks, and styling.
- Use the project-installed HeroUI skills in `.agents/skills/` as persistent local guidance, and use `https://heroui.com/react/llms.txt` as the lightweight docs index.
- For broader static reference, use `https://heroui.com/react/llms-full.txt`; for narrower reference, use `https://heroui.com/react/llms-components.txt` or `https://heroui.com/react/llms-patterns.txt`.
- Treat broad renames as suspicious until verified against the docs, because many v3 components use compound APIs rather than simple find-and-replace migrations.
- In progress updates or final summaries, state which HeroUI docs were checked when HeroUI migration work was involved.

---

## Git & Commits

**Commit directly to `main`.** Do not create feature branches or PRs — this is a solo project and the branch-per-change workflow adds unnecessary overhead.

When committing code, always use `--no-verify` flag if pre-commit hooks fail due to pre-existing issues in unstaged files. Do not spend multiple cycles trying to fix pre-existing lint/test errors that are unrelated to the current changes.

Pre-commit hooks (husky/eslint) have known pre-existing failures. When commits are blocked by pre-existing lint or test errors unrelated to current changes, use `--no-verify` to bypass rather than attempting to fix all pre-existing issues.

#### 🔴 EXCEPTION — never `--no-verify` past the test verify-gate

The `pre-commit` hook (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`, installed via `bash scripts/git-hooks/install-hooks.sh`) runs **only the PHP test files staged in the current commit**. A failure there is, by definition, in a file *you are committing right now* — it is never "pre-existing" or "unrelated". If this gate fails, **fix the test or drop the file. Do NOT `--no-verify` past it.** This exists because automated coverage/test batches repeatedly landed broken tests on `main` and turned CI red. The `--no-verify` allowance above applies ONLY to pre-existing lint/build failures in files you did not change.

Any automated loop that generates and commits test batches MUST let this gate run (no `--no-verify`); if it commits a failing test, it has broken `main` for everyone.

### Git Commit Convention

```
feat: Add new feature       fix: Bug fix           docs: Documentation only
style: Formatting           refactor: Restructure  test: Adding tests
chore: Maintenance

Example: feat(wallet): Add time credit transfer confirmation modal
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### GitHub PR Gates (READ BEFORE OPENING ANY PR)

Some environments (Claude Code on the web, GitHub Actions) force a branch + PR workflow. PRs in this repo are gated by **description checks** that fail instantly unless the PR body contains exact fields from `.github/pull_request_template.md`. These gates re-run when the PR body is **edited** — no push needed to clear them.

When opening a PR, always build the body from `.github/pull_request_template.md`. The hard requirements:

1. **Root Cause Analysis Check** — any PR whose title starts with `fix` or contains `bug`/`hotfix` MUST include literal `**Root Cause:**` and `**Prevention:**` fields (the colon is required; a `### Root Cause` heading does NOT satisfy it).
2. **Translation Review Check** — any PR touching `react-frontend/public/locales/<non-en>/*.json` MUST include `**Translation Status:** reviewed` (or `approved`) and `**Translation Reviewer:** @handle`. Owner-authored PRs are exempt; call out machine-filled translations in a `**Translation Notes:**` field regardless.
3. **Contributor Terms Acceptance** — the `## Contributor Terms` section with all three checkboxes checked (`- [x]`) plus `**Third-Party Material Disclosure:**` and `**AI Contribution Disclosure:**` fields (use `None` when not applicable). Owner-authored and bot PRs are exempt.
4. **Translation Drift Detection** — `node scripts/check-php-lang-parity.mjs` must pass. If you add keys to `lang/en/*.php`, add translated counterparts to ALL other `lang/<locale>/*.php` files in the same commit.

### 🔴 Keep `main` green

A failing check on `main` is inherited by **every** subsequent PR and trains everyone to ignore CI. If a push to `main` turns any CI gate red (lang parity, i18n baseline, build), fix it or revert it immediately — do not leave it for "later". Before starting feature work on a branch, if CI on `main` is already red for a mechanical reason (e.g. missing translation keys), fix that first in its own commit so your PR isn't born failing.

---

## Code Patterns

PHP patterns: follow existing services in `app/Services/` (the conventions doc has been retired).

### Multi-Tenant Awareness (CRITICAL)

**Always scope queries by tenant:**

```php
$tenantId = TenantContext::getId();
$stmt = Database::query(
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE tenant_id = ? AND status = ?",
    [$tenantId, 'active']
);
```

**CRITICAL**: Never pass arrays to query parameters. Use `implode(',', array_fill(...))` for IN clauses.

### Key Patterns

- **Services**: Static methods, always scope by `TenantContext::getId()`
- **Controllers**: `jsonResponse()` + `getJsonInput()` helpers
- **Authentication**: `Auth::user()`, `ApiAuth::authenticate()` (token-based), `Csrf::token()`
- **Feature gating**: `TenantContext::hasFeature('events')` (PHP) / `useTenant().hasFeature('events')` (React)

---

## Validation Commands

### Backend CI gates

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=Laravel,LaravelMigrated --colors=always
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --no-progress --memory-limit=512M --error-format=github
```

### React / Frontend checks

```bash
cd react-frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
cd react-frontend && npm run build
cd react-frontend && npm test
```

### i18n checks (run after any locale changes)

```bash
npm run check:i18n:baseline
npm run check:i18n:gaps
```

### E2E / Browser tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e
npx playwright test e2e/tests/smoke.spec.ts --grep '@smoke' --project=chromium-modern
```

E2E defaults to `http://localhost:5173`; use `E2E_BASE_URL=...` only when deliberately targeting another environment. Run Playwright from the root dependency tree — do not keep a nested `e2e/node_modules` alongside root Playwright.

### Accessible frontend

```bash
npm run build:accessible-frontend
npm run test:accessible-frontend:php
npm run test:accessible-frontend:a11y
```

---

npm run build                               # Production build
```

Test environment: `APP_ENV=testing`, `DB_DATABASE=nexus_test`, `CACHE_DRIVER=array`.

> **🔴 NOTE — running PHP tests via `docker exec` that use `Crypt`/encryption:** You MUST pass the test `APP_KEY` explicitly on the `docker exec` line. The container's `.env` ships a dev placeholder (`APP_KEY=nexus-dev-app-key-change-in-production`) that is **not** a valid base64 32-byte key. Laravel loads that value into config during app bootstrap, and phpunit.xml's `<env name="APP_KEY" force="true">` does **not** reliably override it for the `Encrypter` singleton inside the container — so any test that touches `Crypt` (e.g. the federation listener tests in `tests/Laravel/Unit/Listeners/`: `PushGroupToFederatedPartnersTest`, `PushGroupMembershipToFederatedPartnersTest`, `PushGroupRetractionToFederatedPartnersTest`, `PushMemberProfileUpdateToFederatedPartnersTest`) fails with `RuntimeException: Unsupported cipher or incorrect key length` from `Encrypter.php`.
>
> **Fix:** add `-e APP_KEY="base64:HfQEDtbtr90JIXhsaAhSFWnzIo1f31VZ2e5qLqKKnls="` (the same fixed, non-secret test key already in `phpunit.xml`) to the `docker exec` command:
>
> ```bash
> docker exec \
>   -e MAIL_MAILER=array \
>   -e APP_KEY="base64:HfQEDtbtr90JIXhsaAhSFWnzIo1f31VZ2e5qLqKKnls=" \
>   nexus-php-app php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Laravel/Unit/Listeners/...
> ```
>
> This applies to CI and any local `docker exec` run. The `-e APP_KEY=...` flag is not needed when running phpunit directly on the host, where phpunit.xml's `<env>` is authoritative.

## Deployment

Full deployment guide: [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Host** | Azure VM — IP in `.secrets.local/deploy.env` as `PROD_SSH_HOST` |
| **SSH** | `ssh -i "$PROD_SSH_KEY" azureuser@"$PROD_SSH_HOST"` (see `.secrets.local/deploy.env`) |
| **Deploy Path** | `/opt/nexus-php/` |
| **Deploy Script** | `scripts/deploy/bluegreen-deploy.sh` (canonical production deploy engine) |
| **Legacy Wrapper** | `scripts/safe-deploy.sh` (compatibility shim only; production delegates to blue-green) |
| **Method** | Zero-downtime blue/green switch via Apache route file |

**Preferred: gated deploy from the dev machine.** Run `bash scripts/deploy.sh` — it runs the larastan/PHPStan static-analysis gate first (catches the job-offers class of bug; only NEW findings beyond `phpstan-baseline.neon` block — override a false alarm with `ALLOW_PHPSTAN_FAIL=1`), then pushes and runs the blue/green deploy below. The gate runs locally in the `nexus-php-app` container, so it adds only a couple of minutes and can't break the server-side deploy. The raw steps below still work as a fallback.

```bash
# Step 1: Push code
git push origin main

# Step 2: Deploy with the canonical blue-green engine
source .secrets.local/deploy.env
ssh -i "$PROD_SSH_KEY" -o RequestTTY=force "$PROD_SSH_USER@$PROD_SSH_HOST" \
  "cd /opt/nexus-php && sudo bash scripts/deploy/bluegreen-deploy.sh deploy --detach"

# Step 3: Check progress
source .secrets.local/deploy.env
ssh -i "$PROD_SSH_KEY" -o RequestTTY=force "$PROD_SSH_USER@$PROD_SSH_HOST" \
  "cd /opt/nexus-php && sudo bash scripts/deploy/bluegreen-deploy.sh logs"

# Other modes
sudo bash scripts/deploy/bluegreen-deploy.sh rollback --detach # Rollback to previous color
sudo bash scripts/deploy/bluegreen-deploy.sh status            # Show active color + deploy status
sudo bash scripts/deploy/bluegreen-deploy.sh logs              # Blue-green specific log tail
sudo bash scripts/deploy/bluegreen-deploy.sh logs -f           # Follow blue-green log live
sudo bash scripts/deploy/bluegreen-deploy.sh monitor           # Live monitor dashboard
```

> **ALWAYS use `--detach` for deploys.** Docker builds take 10+ minutes. Without `--detach`, SSH will timeout mid-build.
>
> **How it works on production:** `bluegreen-deploy.sh` builds and tests the inactive color while the active color keeps serving live traffic. The Apache route file is atomically swapped after smoke checks pass: **zero downtime, no maintenance window.**

### 🔴 Critical Deploy Rules

1. **Blue-green builds the inactive color** — the live color keeps serving; no maintenance window required
2. **Never build React locally and upload `dist/`** — always rebuild on server inside the container image
3. **Cloudflare cache purge after every deploy** — automated, fires after traffic switch + smoke tests pass
4. **Do not use `safe-deploy.sh quick/full` as the normal production command** — those modes are legacy maintenance-mode fallback paths only

### Container Ownership

**Our containers (production — blue-green):** `nexus-blue-php-app`, `nexus-blue-react`, `nexus-blue-sales`, `nexus-blue-php-queue`, `nexus-blue-php-scheduler`, `nexus-green-php-app`, `nexus-green-react`, `nexus-green-sales`, `nexus-green-php-queue`, `nexus-green-php-scheduler`, `nexus-php-db`, `nexus-php-redis`, `nexus-meilisearch`.

**Legacy single-color containers** (may still exist on first migration): `nexus-php-app`, `nexus-react-prod`, `nexus-sales-site`, `nexus-php-queue`, `nexus-php-scheduler`.

**NEVER touch:** `nexus-backend-*`, `nexus-frontend-*`, `nexus-uk-*`, `nexus-civic-*` — they belong to other projects.

---

## 🔴 Global Maintenance Mode (CRITICAL — CANONICAL METHOD)

**This section documents the ONLY reliable method for putting the entire Project NEXUS platform into maintenance mode. Do NOT improvise, guess, or use alternative approaches. Updated 2026-03-21.**

When maintenance mode is ON, **all tenants across the entire platform** are blocked. Two independent layers enforce this — **BOTH must be toggled together**.

| Layer | Mechanism | Where checked | What it blocks |
|-------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Layer 1: File** | `.maintenance` file in PHP container | `httpdocs/index.php` line 16 (pre-framework) | ALL HTTP traffic except localhost |
| **Layer 2: Database** | `tenant_settings.general.maintenance_mode` | Laravel `CheckMaintenanceMode` middleware + React `TenantShell` | Non-admin API requests + React frontend |

**`scripts/maintenance.sh` controls BOTH layers atomically.** One command toggles both.

```bash
# Enable maintenance mode (file + database, all tenants, immediate)
sudo bash scripts/maintenance.sh on

# Disable maintenance mode (file + database, all tenants, immediate)
sudo bash scripts/maintenance.sh off

# Check both layers' status
sudo bash scripts/maintenance.sh status
```

**Blue-green path (production):** The deploy script does NOT use maintenance mode. The inactive color builds and tests while the live color keeps serving.

**Migrations run automatically.** As of 2026-05-03, `bluegreen-deploy.sh deploy` runs `php artisan migrate --force` against the new color before the traffic switch. Pass `--no-migrate` only for emergency rollback deploys.

**NEVER toggle only one layer.** Always use `maintenance.sh` which handles both.

---

## Database & Migrations

- Before writing code that queries tables, verify actual column names via schema inspection — do not assume.
- When generating migrations, check for FK column type consistency (signed vs unsigned int) against referenced tables.
- Use current Laravel 12 migration APIs; avoid deprecated patterns.

### Schema Dump (for fresh database setup)

`database/schema/mysql-schema.sql` contains the **full database schema** plus `laravel_migrations` table data. This is committed to git so new contributors can set up a working database with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker exec nexus-php-app php artisan migrate   # loads schema dump + runs any newer migrations
```

**Keeping it current:** To refresh manually:

```bash
bash scripts/refresh-schema-dump.sh             # local Docker
bash scripts/refresh-schema-dump.sh --production # on production server
```

After refreshing, **commit the updated `database/schema/mysql-schema.sql` to git**.

### Laravel Migrations (primary system)

New schema changes go in `database/migrations/` using standard Laravel migrations (`php artisan make:migration`). Use `Schema::hasTable()` / `Schema::hasColumn()` guards for idempotency.

### Legacy SQL Migrations

Located in `/migrations/` with timestamp naming. **Do not add new legacy SQL migrations** — use Laravel migrations instead.

### 🔴 Running migrations on production — CORRECT METHOD

**Laravel migrations (preferred):**
```bash
source .secrets.local/deploy.env
ssh -i "$PROD_SSH_KEY" -o RequestTTY=force "$PROD_SSH_USER@$PROD_SSH_HOST" \
    "sudo docker exec nexus-php-app php artisan migrate --force"
```

**Legacy SQL migrations (if needed):**
Use the checked-in wrappers below. Do not publish production hostnames, database credentials, or copied one-off shell snippets in documentation.

**Why `-o RequestTTY=force`?** Sudoers has `use_pty` — sudo refuses without a terminal. `-t` and `-tt` fail when stdin isn't a TTY. `-o RequestTTY=force` is the only flag that works.

**After running migrations, refresh the schema dump:**
```bash
bash scripts/refresh-schema-dump.sh
# Then commit the updated database/schema/mysql-schema.sql
```

### Migration workflow (Makefile wrappers)

Prefer the checked-in wrappers for raw SQL migrations:
- `make migrate FILE=...`
- `make migrate-dry FILE=...`
- `make migrate-prod FILE=...`
- `make migrate-prod-dry FILE=...`
- `make drift-check`

---

## Regression Prevention

(The standalone regression-prevention doc has been retired; the layers are summarised below.)

**7 layers:** Pre-commit hooks (Husky + lint-staged) → Pre-push (tsc + build) → CI pipeline (5 stages) → PR enforcement → Zod runtime validation (dev only) → Local scripts → Deploy rules.

### Mandatory Rules (NEVER SKIP)

1. **`--no-cache` on production builds**
2. **Restart `nexus-php-app` after PHP deploys** (OPCache)
3. **Never double-unwrap** — `response.data` IS the final data
4. **Every DELETE/UPDATE must include `AND tenant_id = ?`** on tenant-scoped tables
5. **Dockerfile limits must match** between `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.prod`
6. **Fix PRs must explain Root Cause + Prevention** — enforced by CI

---

## Common Tasks

### Add a New API Endpoint

1. Create controller in `app/Http/Controllers/Api/`
2. Add route in `routes/api.php`
3. Add tests in `tests/Laravel/Feature/Controllers/`

### Add a New Service

1. Create in `app/Services/` (scope by tenant — see existing services)
2. Always scope by tenant — follow existing services
3. Add unit tests

### Add a New Page (React Frontend)

1. Create page in `react-frontend/src/pages/`
2. Use HeroUI + Tailwind CSS — see [react-frontend/CLAUDE.md](react-frontend/CLAUDE.md)
3. Add route in `App.tsx` with `FeatureGate` if needed
4. Add `usePageTitle()` hook
5. Use `tenantPath()` for internal links

### Add a Database Migration

1. Create migration: `php artisan make:migration add_foo_to_bar_table`
2. Use `Schema::hasTable()` / `Schema::hasColumn()` guards for idempotency
3. Run locally: `docker exec nexus-php-app php artisan migrate`
4. Refresh schema dump: `bash scripts/refresh-schema-dump.sh`
5. Commit both the migration file AND the updated `database/schema/mysql-schema.sql`

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Prepared statements (never concatenate SQL)
- [ ] CSRF tokens on forms
- [ ] Scope all queries by `tenant_id`
- [ ] `htmlspecialchars()` for output
