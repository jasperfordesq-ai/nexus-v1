> 📖 **Documentation** — browse the full, searchable documentation site at **<https://jasperfordesq-ai.github.io/nexus-v1/>** (module guides, architecture, and an interactive API reference). The Markdown sources live in [docs/](docs/README.md).

> 🌐 **Live demo** — see the platform running in production: the [React frontend](https://app.project-nexus.ie) (primary UI) and the [accessible HTML-first frontend](https://accessible.project-nexus.ie). The PHP API is served from `https://api.project-nexus.ie`.

> **Version 1.5.4 — Generally Available** — Project NEXUS V1.5.4 is generally available and in active production use. The platform runs on Laravel 12 + PHP 8.2+ with a React 19 frontend. It is currently in use by communities in **Ireland** and being evaluated by communities in the **United Kingdom**, **Spain**, **Switzerland**, and the **United States**. Newer modules may still ship with their own per-module maturity label (Beta / Preview). Contributions and feedback are welcome.

A modern, multi-tenant community time banking platform built with Laravel 12 + PHP 8.2+, React 19, and MariaDB.

## What is Time Banking?

Time banking is a community-based system where members exchange services using time as currency. One hour of service always equals one time credit, regardless of the type of service — everyone's time is valued equally.

## Features

- **Time Credits & Wallet** — Earn and spend time credits for community services
- **Listings Marketplace** — Browse and post service offers and requests
- **Private Messaging** — Connect directly with community members
- **Events** — Organise community gatherings with RSVP tracking
- **Groups** — Interest-based community groups and discussions
- **Social Feed** — Community posts, comments, likes, and polls
- **Gamification** — Badges, achievements, XP, leaderboards, and challenges
- **Volunteering** — Volunteer opportunities and hour logging
- **Blog & Resources** — Community news and shared resource library
- **Federation API** — Multi-community network with cross-community exchanges and federated identity
- **Smart Matching** — AI-powered matching of members and listings
- **Exchange Workflow** — Broker-approved service exchange lifecycle
- **Multi-Tenant** — Run multiple communities from one platform, each with its own branding and configuration
- **PWA & Native Mobile** — Progressive Web App, with native app packaging managed outside the default Docker setup
- **Real-Time** — Pusher WebSockets for live updates, FCM for mobile push
- **Internationalisation** — 11 supported languages: English, Irish (Gaeilge), German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Polish, Japanese, Arabic (with full RTL support)
- **Light/Dark Theme** — System-aware theme with per-user preference

## Architecture

Project NEXUS is a multi-tenant Laravel 12 API with two frontends (a React 19 SPA and an HTML-first accessible frontend), backed by MariaDB, Redis, and Meilisearch, and deployed with a zero-downtime blue/green container switch.

## Repository Topology

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/`, `routes/`, `config/`, `bootstrap/` | Laravel 12 application, API routing, middleware, providers, and runtime configuration |
| `react-frontend/` | Primary React 19 + TypeScript UI for members and current admin workflows |
| `accessible-frontend/` | Accessibility-first, HTML-first frontend served by Laravel at `accessible.project-nexus.ie` and `/{tenantSlug}/alpha/...` |
| `views/` | Live email templates (`views/emails/match_*.php`) and the module-404 page; everything else under `views/` is retired legacy code |
| `httpdocs/` | Apache web root, public health endpoints, and compatibility entrypoints |
| `database/`, `migrations/` | Laravel migrations, schema dump, and legacy SQL history |
| `tests/`, `e2e/`, `playwright.config.ts` | PHPUnit, integration, and browser test coverage |
| `docs/` | Maintained public operations, platform, and governance documentation |
| `.github/` | CI, security, contributor, release, and dependency automation |
| `scripts/` | Build, migration, deployment, maintenance, and audit tooling |

Native mobile project artifacts are not required for the public Docker setup. The React PWA is the canonical user interface; native packaging is release-managed separately from normal local development.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jasperfordesq-ai/nexus-v1.git
cd nexus-v1

# Copy the example environment file and fill in your values
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker

# Start database, Redis, and Meilisearch
docker compose up -d

# Start Docker PHP if you are using the containerized backend
docker compose --profile docker-php up -d app

# Start the React frontend with native Vite
npm run dev:frontend

# Run Laravel migrations to set up the database schema
docker exec nexus-php-app php artisan migrate

# Access the application
# React Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# PHP API:        http://localhost:8090 (Docker) or http://127.0.0.1:8088 (maintainer native)
# Sales Site:     http://localhost:3001
# Accessible UI:  http://localhost:8090/hour-timebank/alpha

# Native app packaging is separate from the default Docker workflow
```

## Database Setup

Run Laravel migrations after starting Docker to create the schema:

```bash
docker exec nexus-php-app php artisan migrate
```

The full current schema dump is committed at [database/schema/mysql-schema.sql](database/schema/mysql-schema.sql). Zero-downtime deployments use a blue/green container switch (see `scripts/deploy/bluegreen-deploy.sh`).

## Project Status

This is **version 1.5.4 — generally available**, in active production use. Per-module maturity (GA / Beta / Preview) is published on the in-app `/features` page and the public Changelog:

- The **React frontend** (`react-frontend/`) is the primary UI for user-facing pages and current admin workflows
- The **Accessible frontend** (`accessible-frontend/`) is an approved HTML-first UI track for core tenant pages, served by Laravel and planned for `accessible.project-nexus.ie`
- The **Laravel 12 backend** provides the API — all services are native Laravel implementations (zero stubs)
- The **legacy PHP admin** (`/admin-legacy/`, `/super-admin/`) has been decommissioned — all admin workflows live in the React admin
- **Zero-downtime blue/green deployments** — production switches between blue and green container stacks with no maintenance window
- **Native mobile packaging** is managed separately from the default public Docker checkout
- **Tests** are in `tests/`, `react-frontend/src/**/*.test.*`, and `e2e/`; CI also runs static analysis, build, migration, i18n, SPDX, smoke, accessibility, and security gates

We welcome contributors who are comfortable working with a modern Laravel + React codebase.

## Related Projects

Project NEXUS is moving toward two backend editions that can share the same
React frontend contract:

| Edition | Stack | Repository |
| ------- | ----- | --------- |
| **Laravel Edition** (this repo) | Laravel 12 + PHP 8.2+ / React 19 / MariaDB | [nexus-v1](https://github.com/jasperfordesq-ai/nexus-v1) |
| **.NET Edition** | ASP.NET Core 8 / React 19 / PostgreSQL | [api.project-nexus.net](https://github.com/jasperfordesq-ai/api.project-nexus.net) |

The **Laravel Edition** (this repo) is the canonical, in-production platform and the foundation of all Project NEXUS communities. It runs on Laravel 12 + PHP 8.2+ with the production React 19 frontend. The **.NET Edition** is an experimental, development-only backend that must conform to the Laravel React API contract before it can safely use the same frontend. The portability roadmap and safety rules are documented in [docs/REACT-DUAL-BACKEND.md](docs/REACT-DUAL-BACKEND.md).
