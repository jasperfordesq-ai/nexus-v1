# Project NEXUS — Maestro E2E Mobile Tests

Last reviewed: 2026-07-14

Maestro is a lightweight mobile UI testing framework that drives iOS Simulators and Android Emulators (or real devices) by replaying YAML flow files against the running app. Flows tap, type, scroll, and assert exactly as a real user would.

---

## Installing Maestro

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -Ls "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash

# Verify installation
maestro --version
```

On Windows, use WSL2 with the Linux install above, or download the Maestro JAR manually from https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/maestro/releases.

## Running flows

All flows target bundle ID `ie.project.nexus` (iOS) / package `ie.project.nexus` (Android).

```bash
# Run all flows in numbered order
maestro test .maestro/

# Run a single flow
maestro test .maestro/01-auth-login.yaml

# Run with credentials supplied as env vars (required for auth flows)
maestro test \
  --env TEST_EMAIL=user@example.com \
  --env TEST_PASSWORD=secret \
  .maestro/

# Upload flows to Maestro Cloud (device farm)
maestro cloud --apiKey $MAESTRO_API_KEY .maestro/
```

## Required environment variables

| Variable        | Description                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `TEST_EMAIL`    | Email address of an existing test account         |
| `TEST_PASSWORD` | Password for that account                         |

Credentials are injected via `--env` and referenced in flows as `${TEST_EMAIL}` / `${TEST_PASSWORD}`. They are **never hardcoded** in any flow file.

## Flow index

| File | Description | Requires session? |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `01-auth-login.yaml` | Login with valid credentials, assert Feed tab | No (clearState) |
| `02-auth-logout.yaml` | Navigate to Profile, Sign out, assert login screen | Yes (from 01) |
| `03-browse-listings.yaml` | Listings tab: search "garden", clear, scroll | Re-auths if needed |
| `04-browse-groups.yaml` | Profile > Groups: filter pills, search "community" | Re-auths if needed |
| `05-view-events.yaml` | Feed tab: scroll through event cards | Re-auths if needed |
| `06-messages-flow.yaml` | Messages tab: load, scroll, no crash | Re-auths if needed |
| `07-profile-explore.yaml` | Profile Explore: Achievements + AI Assistant | Re-auths if needed |
| `08-search-flow.yaml` | Profile > Search: type query, assert filter pills | Re-auths if needed |
| `09-registration-flow.yaml` | Registration form renders correctly (no submit) | No (clearState) |

Flows `03`–`08` include an inline re-authentication block that handles expired sessions, so they can be run independently or as part of the full suite.

## Tenant selection screen

On a completely fresh install (`clearState: true`) the app may show a **"Select your timebank"** screen before the login form. Flows `01` and `09` handle this with a conditional `runFlow` block that taps the `hour-timebank` entry if the screen appears. If the tenant is already stored, the block is skipped automatically.

---

## CI status

Maestro is currently an operator-run device test, not a GitHub Actions gate. The main CI workflow runs the blocking Android release-policy check, typecheck, Jest suite, Expo Doctor, and generated-native-policy inspection; it does not launch an emulator or submit an EAS build. EAS build and submission commands remain deliberate operator actions documented in [`../docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`](../docs/DISTRIBUTION.md).

If a device-farm gate is added later, start from a preview APK and pass credentials only through repository secrets. For example:

```yaml
- name: Run Maestro E2E tests
  run: |
    maestro cloud \
      --apiKey ${{ secrets.MAESTRO_API_KEY }} \
      --app-file path/to/app.apk \
      .maestro/
  env:
    TEST_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.E2E_TEST_EMAIL }}
    TEST_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.E2E_TEST_PASSWORD }}
```

Required additional secrets: `MAESTRO_API_KEY`, `E2E_TEST_EMAIL`, `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD`.
