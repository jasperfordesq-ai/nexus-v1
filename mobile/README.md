# Timebank Global - Mobile App

React Native (Expo) mobile client for the [Project NEXUS](https://github.com/jasperfordesq-ai/nexus-v1) timebanking platform.

Release identity, package IDs, and website/Play Store distribution decisions are recorded in [docs/DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Expo CLI through `npx expo` or the local npm scripts
- For Android: Android Studio + emulator, or a physical device with Expo Go
- For iOS: Xcode + Simulator (macOS only), or a physical device with Expo Go

---

## Setup

```bash
cd mobile
npm install   # .npmrc sets legacy-peer-deps=true automatically
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL to your API endpoint
```

### Asset Placeholders

Before building (not required for Expo Go dev):

```bash
# Replace assets/ placeholders with real images:
#   icon.png          1024x1024
#   splash.png        1284x2778
#   adaptive-icon.png 1024x1024 (Android)
```

---

## Development

```bash
# Start Expo dev server (opens QR code)
cd mobile && npm start

# Run on Android emulator / connected device
npm run android

# Run on iOS simulator (macOS only)
npm run ios

# TypeScript check
npm run type-check
```

Scan the QR code with **Expo Go** on your phone, or press `a` / `i` in the terminal to open an emulator.

## API URL Configuration

The app reads `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` from environment. Set this in `.env.local`:

| Target | URL |
|--------|-----|
| Production | `https://api.project-nexus.ie` |
| Android emulator -> local Docker API | `http://10.0.2.2:8090` |
| iOS simulator -> local Docker API | `http://localhost:8090` |
| Local device on LAN | `http://<your-computer-ip>:8090` |

The default tenant (`EXPO_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_TENANT`) is `hour-timebank`; change this to test with a different tenant.

---

## Architecture

### Stack

| Concern | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Framework | Expo SDK 54 (managed workflow) |
| Language | TypeScript strict |
| Navigation | Expo Router (file-based, like Next.js) |
| UI | HeroUI Native `^1.0.4` + Uniwind + Tailwind CSS 4 |
| Auth storage | `expo-secure-store` (encrypted at rest) |
| HTTP | Native `fetch` with typed wrapper (`lib/api/client.ts`) |
| State | React Context + hooks (no external state library) |
| Icons | `@expo/vector-icons` (Ionicons) |
| Authentication | Password + authenticator-app 2FA (native passkeys planned) |
| Real-time messaging | Pusher WebSockets (private channels, end-to-end encrypted transport) |
| Push notifications | Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) via Expo Notifications |

```

### HeroUI Native

This app uses HeroUI Native, not HeroUI React web APIs. The root layout imports `global.css`, wraps the app in `GestureHandlerRootView`, and mounts `HeroUINativeProvider`. `global.css` imports Tailwind CSS, Uniwind, and `heroui-native/styles`.

Prefer the shared wrappers in `components/ui` for app screens:

- `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `Badge`/`Chip`, `Toggle`, `Checkbox`, `BottomSheet`, `ActionSheet`, `LoadingSpinner`, and `EmptyState`
- Direct `heroui-native` primitives for dense compound layouts where the wrapper would fight the native component anatomy
- Native React Native primitives for layout, lists, media, maps, gesture surfaces, and platform APIs

See `docs/WRAPPER_POLICY.md` for the wrapper-vs-primitive policy and locale guide, and `docs/HEROUI_NATIVE_PARITY_AUDIT.md` for the current parity matrix.

### Auth Flow

1. App mounts and `AuthContext` reads the stored JWT from `expo-secure-store`.
2. If a token exists, `GET /api/v2/users/me` validates it and redirects to `/(tabs)/home`.
3. If no token exists or validation fails, the app redirects to `/(auth)/login`.
4. On login, credentials are posted, the JWT is stored, and the app redirects to tabs.
5. On 401 from any API call, credentials are cleared and the app redirects to login through `lib/api/client.ts`.

#### WebAuthn / Passkeys

Native passkey authentication is not implemented in the Expo app yet. The current mobile login flow is password/TOTP based; do not expose the web passkey module switch as mobile capability. A future native implementation must use the iOS/Android platform credential APIs, configure the required associated-domain/app-link files for every supported tenant RP ID, and conform to the web API's origin, tenant, user-verification, and recovery policy before this section can claim support.

### Multi-Tenancy

Every API request includes an `X-Tenant-Slug` header set by `lib/api/client.ts` from storage. `TenantContext` loads tenant config and branding on startup and exposes `hasFeature(key)` for conditional UI.

To switch tenant, call `setTenantSlug(slug)` from `useTenant()`.

---

## Verification

```bash
cd mobile
npm run type-check
npm test -- --runInBand --silent
```

Focused route/component tests are useful during migration work, but run the commands above before considering a HeroUI Native or parity pass complete. The Jest suite may emit known Uniwind/HeroUI Native test-environment warnings; document any command timeout or open-handle behavior in the parity audit.

---

## Production Build (EAS)

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
npm run prepackage             # TypeScript, Jest, Expo Doctor
npm run build:android:website  # APK for website/internal tester downloads
npm run build:android:play     # AAB for Google Play
npm run submit:android:internal # Submit latest AAB to Play internal testing
```

Configure `eas.json` before submitting. See [Expo EAS docs](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/).

## Notes

- **No business logic in the app**: all logic lives in the PHP API.
- **Real-time messaging**: Pusher WebSocket channels are established after login and torn down on logout. Private channels use server-side auth (`/api/v2/pusher/auth`).
- **Push notifications**: FCM tokens are registered on login via `POST /api/v2/notifications/device-token` and deregistered on logout. Requires `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) in the project root before any EAS build.
- **AGPL-3.0 attribution** is displayed in the Profile/About screen as required by Section 7(b) and Section 13. The attribution notice must include a copyright notice and visible source repository link: <https://github.com/jasperfordesq-ai/nexus-v1>.
- Replace `assets/` placeholder images before any public build. When the generated notification icon is ready, save it as `assets/notification-icon.png` (96x96, white on transparent). The dynamic Expo config will use it automatically when the file exists.
- Add `google-services.json` at the project root before push-notification production builds. It is gitignored and will be added to native config automatically when present.
