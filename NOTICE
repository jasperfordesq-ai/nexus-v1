RELATED PROJECTS
================================================================================

Project NEXUS is actively developed across two codebases:

  V1 (this repository):
    PHP 8.2+ / React 18 / MariaDB
    https://github.com/jasperfordesq-ai/nexus-v1

  V2 (new backend):
    ASP.NET Core 8 / React 18 / PostgreSQL
    https://github.com/jasperfordesq-ai/api.project-nexus.net

V1 is the original platform — functional, in production, and the foundation
of all Project NEXUS communities. V2 is a new backend being built alongside
V1, progressively replacing the PHP API. Both share the same React frontend
and design system.

Note: This section is informational. The attribution requirements in
Section 7(b) above apply to THIS repository only. References to V2 are
provided for context and are not required for downstream compliance.
