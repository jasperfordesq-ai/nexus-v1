/**
 * Alarm self-test heartbeat — the watcher-of-the-watcher.
 *
 * NEXUS already has three breach alarms (SloCheck, StuckStripeWebhookCheck,
 * OverdueGdprRequestCheck) that fan out log → Sentry → Slack. But those only
 * fire WHEN something is wrong. If the delivery path itself silently breaks
 * (DSN rotated, Slack webhook revoked, the `sentry` log channel dropped from
 * LOG_STACK), the alarms would go quiet and nobody would know — the most
 * dangerous failure mode for an unattended real-money system, because silence
 * reads as "all healthy".
 *
 * This command fires a benign weekly HEARTBEAT through the SAME three legs an
 * alarm would use. The operator's expectation is inverted: you should receive
 * this heartbeat every week. If it ever stops arriving (in Sentry or Slack),
 * the alarm delivery path is broken — which is the signal you could never get
 * from the alarms themselves. It is NOT an alarm: it always exits 0 and is
 * tagged `selftest=heartbeat` so it never pollutes the real-error dashboard.
 *
 * Scheduled weekly via bootstrap/app.php. Each leg is guarded and non-fatal,
 * degrading to log-only when Sentry/Slack are unconfigured — and the console
 * output reports exactly which legs were attempted, so an owner running it by
 * hand can see at a glance whether delivery is wired.
 *
 * Modelled on SloCheck::raiseAlert (log → Sentry → Slack, each leg guarded).
