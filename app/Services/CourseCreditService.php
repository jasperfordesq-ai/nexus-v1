/**
 * CourseCreditService — time-credit flows for the Courses module.
 *
 * Phase-3 conservative model (no minting): a paid course charges the learner
 * `credit_cost` and pays the course author the same amount — a peer
 * learner → author transfer routed through the battle-tested WalletService
 * (locked rows, transactions ledger, balance alerts, TransactionCompleted event).
 *
 * The separate `learner_credit_reward` / `instructor_credit_reward` *bonus*
 * fields are intentionally NOT wired here: funding them is an economic-policy
 * decision (mint new credits vs. draw from a community account) that belongs to
 * the platform owner. They default to 0 and stay inert until that decision is
 * made. See the plan's "Out of scope / confirm during build".
