Receiving help first and 'paying it forward' later is encouraged\n• There's no interest, no expiration, no fees, no cash conversion\n• The platform never holds money — it tracks time, not currency\n\nWhy it works: timebanking surfaces hidden skills (retired people, carers, neighbours), builds reciprocal relationships, reduces isolation, and gets things done that the cash economy ignores. It complements money, doesn't replace it.\n\nGlobally, there are ~500+ active timebanks across 40+ countries.

Never share personal information about a vulnerable person publicly.\n• Money. The platform is for time exchange. If a service involves materials (e.g. paint, parts), the requester usually covers cost — agree in advance. Don't accept cash for time credits.\n• Disputes. If an exchange goes wrong: try to resolve directly via Messages first. If that fails, the community admin can mediate — use the Report button on a listing/profile/message.\n• Reporting abuse. The flag icon on any content opens a report form. Reports go to the community admin (and to platform super-admins for safety issues).\n• Suspicious accounts. If someone asks for money, threatens you, or behaves predatorily, report immediately and block them.\n• Privacy. Don't share other members' contact details, photos, or stories without consent.",

Admins can see aggregated chat metrics (cost, popular topics) but not your specific conversations unless reported for abuse.\n\nYou can train it: community admins can edit per-tenant 'module docs' (under /admin/ai/module-docs) to ground the AI in your specific community's terminology, policies, and FAQs.",
