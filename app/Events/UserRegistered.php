/**
 * Fired when a new user registers on the platform.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this event intentionally does NOT use the SerializesModels trait.
 *
 * SerializesModels stores only the User's class+id in the queue payload and
 * re-fetches via User::findOrFail() at job-pickup time. Because the User model
 * uses HasTenantScope, that re-fetch is filtered by TenantContext::getId() —
 * and Horizon's long-lived worker processes can leak a stale TenantContext
 * between jobs. If the previous job left the context set to tenant 2 and the
 * current event is for a tenant-10 user, findOrFail() returns null → silent
 * ModelNotFoundException → the welcome / activation email is never sent.
 *
 * Default PHP serialization (used here) snapshots the full in-memory User
 * object at dispatch time. Listeners read its attributes from the payload
 * directly, with no DB round-trip, so no TenantScope filter can intervene.
 *
 * Slightly larger queue payload; eliminates an entire class of cross-tenant
 * delivery bugs. Do not re-add SerializesModels.
