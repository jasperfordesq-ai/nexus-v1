# Project NEXUS Documentation

This directory contains the public, maintained documentation for Project NEXUS.

Historical prompts, one-off audits, dated handoff notes, generated reports, PDF exports, and stale planning documents were moved out of `docs/` during the 2026-06-23 cleanup. They remain available locally under `.local-docs-archive/2026-06-23-docs-cleanup/`, which is intentionally ignored by git.

## How the documentation is organised

This documentation follows the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework — four kinds of documentation, each with a different job:

| Kind | What it's for | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tutorial** (learning) | A guided, hands-on first experience. | [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md) |
| **How-to guides** (tasks) | Step-by-step recipes for a specific job. | Operations docs below; task sections inside each module guide. |
| **Reference** (information) | Precise, look-it-up facts. | The [module guides](#module-guides), the [API](API.md) + `openapi.json`, and the architecture/platform docs. |
| **Explanation** (understanding) | The "why" behind the design. | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), [I18N.md](I18N.md), [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md), [CI.md](CI.md), [GOVERNANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE.md), [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md). |

New to the project? Start with the [tutorial](TUTORIAL.md), then skim [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), then dive into the [module guide](#module-guides) for whatever you're changing.

## Publication Standards

Before adding a document here:

- keep it useful to a future maintainer, not just useful to one finished task;
- remove secrets, live credentials, private contact details, machine-local paths, and personal notes;
- avoid publishing raw prompts, handoffs, scratch plans, generated audit dumps, and exported PDFs;
- mark dated verification records clearly with the date and command used;
- prefer current code paths such as `app/`, `database/migrations/`, `routes/api.php`, and `react-frontend/`;
- list every public document in this index;
- move local-only material to `.local-docs-archive/` instead of committing it;
- run `npm run check:docs` before committing documentation changes.
- run `npm run check:version` after changing release/version labels or public collateral.

The docs hygiene check fails on task-output filenames, oversized docs, non-Markdown files, missing index links, broken local links, stale retired-doc references, old namespace/path references, stale platform-version phrases, generated artifacts in public doc paths, and obvious secret patterns.
