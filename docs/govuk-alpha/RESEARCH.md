# GOV.UK-Based Accessible Frontend Research

Last reviewed: 2026-07-14

## Architecture Decision

Project NEXUS Accessible Frontend is an approved exception to the React-primary UI rule. It is an isolated, HTML-first Laravel frontend that complements `react-frontend/` and does not replace it. It follows GOV.UK Frontend implementation standards for accessibility and resilience, but it is not a GOV.UK service and must not look or read like one.

The public-facing accessible frontend is now Beta and served under `/{tenantSlug}/accessible/...` (legacy `/alpha/...` URLs permanently redirect). The `GovukAlpha`, `govuk_alpha`, and `govuk-alpha.*` names remain as internal code-path names until a deliberate namespace migration is done.

The accessible frontend uses:

- Laravel routes under `/{tenantSlug}/accessible/...`
- Controllers under `app/Http/Controllers/GovukAlpha/`
- Frontend source under root-level `accessible-frontend/`
- Blade views under `accessible-frontend/views/`
- Sass and TypeScript under `accessible-frontend/src/`
- A separate Vite build output under `httpdocs/build/accessible-frontend/`
- Complete component inventory under `accessible-frontend/COMPONENTS.md`

This structure keeps the accessible frontend as a clear project-root frontend sibling of `react-frontend/`, while still keeping it away from legacy PHP themes in `views/`.

Recommended production subdomain: `accessible.project-nexus.ie`. Avoid `gov`, `govuk`, `ukgov`, or other names that could imply a UK government service.

Deployment target: the Laravel/PHP blue-green app container, not the React frontend container. The accessible frontend is server-rendered by Laravel and should be routed through the PHP/API upstream family in production.

Deployment checks for changes in this frontend:

```bash
npm run build:accessible-frontend
npm run test:accessible-frontend:php
npm run test:accessible-frontend:a11y
```

## GOV.UK Repos To Remember

- `alphagov/govuk-frontend`: official implementation package for Sass, JavaScript, Nunjucks macros, and component CSS classes. https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend
- `alphagov/govuk-design-system`: canonical component, pattern, accessibility, and content guidance. https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system
- `alphagov/govuk-frontend-docs`: technical installation, asset, JavaScript, and update guidance. https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend-docs
- `alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit`: reference for prototypes only, not the production foundation. https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit
- `alphagov/govuk_publishing_components`: implementation reference for GOV.UK publishing components, not the default foundation for Project NEXUS. https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_publishing_components
- `alphagov/frontend`: GOV.UK frontend application reference for production page patterns. https://github.com/alphagov/frontend
- `alphagov/govuk-design-system-architecture`: architecture decisions for GOV.UK Design System, Frontend, and Prototype Kit. https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-architecture

## What We Can Use

- `govuk-frontend` package code, Sass, JavaScript, component classes, and sample markup.
- GOV.UK Design System layout, spacing, typography scale, form, button, summary list, pagination, phase banner, skip link, and grid conventions.
- Progressive-enhancement patterns: working server-rendered HTML first, JavaScript as an enhancement only.
- All official `govuk-frontend` component styles except identity-sensitive GOV.UK header and footer styles.

## What We Cannot Use

- GOV.UK crown.
- GOV.UK logotype.
- GOV.UK header component or footer identity in a way that implies this service is official GOV.UK.
- GDS Transport font.
- Any copy or presentation that suggests Project NEXUS is a UK government service.
- Deprecated GOV.UK packages or repos: `govuk_template`, `govuk_elements`, and `govuk_frontend_toolkit`.
- Unofficial React GOV.UK component libraries as the foundation unless a future decision record documents why official `govuk-frontend` cannot meet the need.

## GOV.UK Frontend Version And Update Process

The current installed Project NEXUS baseline is `govuk-frontend@6.1.0`. The latest stable npm release was verified as `6.3.0` on 2026-06-23. Before upgrading, verify npm and GitHub again; do not move to beta or prerelease builds without a recorded decision.

Before updating:

1. Check the GitHub releases page and npm package version.
2. Confirm the target version is stable, not beta/prerelease.
3. Read the release notes for Sass, asset path, and JavaScript initialization changes.
4. Run the accessible frontend build and scoped accessibility smoke tests.
5. Update this document if branding, font, licensing, or initialization guidance changes.

## Licensing And Attribution

`govuk-frontend` code and sample code are MIT licensed and compatible with this AGPL-3.0-or-later project.

GOV.UK Design System and documentation content is Crown copyright under the Open Government Licence v3.0 unless otherwise stated. Do not copy or closely adapt documentation prose into the app. If future docs copy or closely adapt GOV.UK documentation text, record attribution in `docs/govuk-alpha/ATTRIBUTION.md`.

## Why HTML-First And Progressive Enhancement

The GOV.UK Service Manual requires robust frontends to start with HTML that works, then add CSS and JavaScript as enhancements. That matches this accessible frontend because feed, listings, and member directory journeys are page and form based, need reliable browser navigation, and should remain usable if JavaScript fails.

The accessible frontend therefore uses normal links, GET filters, POST forms, semantic HTML, and GOV.UK Frontend JavaScript only for enhanced behaviours.
