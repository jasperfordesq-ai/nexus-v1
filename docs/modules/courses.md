# Courses Module Guide

Last reviewed: 2026-06-23

This guide is a reference for maintainers of the **Courses** module in Project NEXUS. The module ships a full LMS (learning-management) stack: a course catalogue, structured section/lesson content, drip scheduling, quizzes, progress tracking, completion certificates, per-course discussions, cohort management, and paid enrolment via time credits. Credit flows are routed through the battle-tested `WalletService` — see [docs/modules/wallet-exchanges.md](wallet-exchanges.md) for the ledger invariants.

## Audience & supported workflows

Use this guide when changing course authoring, the enrolment lifecycle, credit charging, progress tracking, quiz grading, certificate issuance, or admin moderation.

Supported workflows:

- **Course discovery** — members browse, filter (by category, level, keyword), and view course details; anonymous visitors see `visibility=public` courses only.
- **Free enrolment** — a member self-enrols at no cost when `credit_cost = 0`.
- **Paid enrolment** — a member pays the course's `credit_cost` in time credits; the charge is a direct learner→author transfer routed through `WalletService::transfer()`.
- **Lesson progress** — a learner works through lessons in order, with optional drip gating, and the system tracks per-lesson and overall completion percentage.
- **Quiz submission** — objective questions (MCQ, multi-select, true/false) are auto-graded; subjective questions (short answer, essay) enter a `pending_review` queue for instructor grading.
- **Course completion** — finishing all lessons triggers certificate issuance, a gamification XP award, and a completion notification + email to the learner.
- **Certificate download** — a completed learner retrieves a printable HTML certificate with a unique serial for verification.
- **Learner review** — enrolled learners rate a course 1–5 stars; the aggregate is cached on the `courses` row.
- **Instructor authoring** — an authorised user builds a course (sections → lessons → quizzes), publishes it, and manages their roster and analytics.
- **Admin moderation** — an admin reviews pending courses, approves/rejects/flags them, manages instructor grants, and views tenant-level analytics.
- **Cohort delivery** — a course-paced variant where learners are assigned to named cohorts with start/end dates and optional capacity limits.
- **Group-linked courses** — `visibility=group` courses are visible only to members of linked groups.

## Tenant & feature-gate rules

**Feature flag: `courses` (default OFF).** Every Courses module endpoint and every controller method calls `ensureCoursesFeature()` as its first step; requests return `FEATURE_DISABLED` (HTTP 403) when the flag is not set. The flag is resolved via `TenantContext::hasFeature('courses')`.

Tenant scoping is enforced automatically by the `HasTenantScope` trait on the `Course`, `CourseEnrollment`, `CourseCertificate`, and related Eloquent models. Every service call that bypasses these scopes (e.g. `Course::withoutGlobalScopes()` in `CourseEnrollmentService::tenantIdForCourse()`) does so explicitly and immediately re-establishes the correct tenant via `TenantContext::runForTenant()`.

Additional per-tenant settings (stored in `tenants.configuration` as JSON):

| Setting key | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `courses.moderation_enabled` | `false` | When `true`, new course publishes stay `pending` until an admin approves via the moderation endpoint. |
| `courses.allow_member_authoring` | `true` | When `false`, only users with an explicit instructor grant or admin role may create courses. |

## Key code & data locations

Routes are defined in [`routes/api.php`](../../routes/api.php) around line 1048. Do not copy the full endpoint table here — read the route file for the live list. Primary entry points:

| Concern | Route prefix | Controller |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Course catalogue & authoring | `/v2/courses` | `App\Http\Controllers\Api\CourseController` |
| Enrolment, progress, certificates, reviews | `/v2/courses/{id}/*`, `/v2/me/courses` | `App\Http\Controllers\Api\CourseEnrollmentController` |
| Section & lesson builder | `/v2/courses/{id}/sections`, `/v2/courses/{id}/lessons` | `App\Http\Controllers\Api\CourseContentController` |
| Quizzes & grading | `/v2/courses/quizzes/*`, `/v2/courses/{id}/grading` | `App\Http\Controllers\Api\CourseQuizController` |
| Cohort management | `/v2/courses/{id}/cohorts` | `App\Http\Controllers\Api\CourseCohortController` |
| Per-lesson discussions | `/v2/courses/{courseId}/lessons/{lessonId}/discussions` | `App\Http\Controllers\Api\CourseDiscussionController` |
| Group links | `/v2/courses/{id}/groups`, `/v2/groups/{id}/courses` | `App\Http\Controllers\Api\CourseGroupController` |
| Admin moderation & analytics | `/v2/admin/courses/*` | `App\Http\Controllers\Api\AdminCourseController` |

The `InteractsWithCourses` trait (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/Concerns/InteractsWithCourses.php`) provides the feature gate check, 404 lookup, authoring authorisation, and audience visibility logic used by all controllers above.

Services:

- `app/Services/CourseService.php` — tenant-scoped course CRUD, browse/search, publish/unpublish lifecycle. Authorship and moderation state are set server-side only and are not mass-assignable.
- `app/Services/CourseEnrollmentService.php` — enrolment creation and idempotency, drop/reactivate, enrolment roster.
- `app/Services/CourseCreditService.php` — time-credit charge for paid enrolment; routes the learner→author transfer through `WalletService::transfer()`.
- `app/Services/CourseLessonService.php` — lesson CRUD and drip availability calculation.
- `app/Services/CourseSectionService.php` — section CRUD.
- `app/Services/CourseProgressService.php` — lesson-completion tracking, progress percentage recomputation, course-completion side effects.
- `app/Services/CourseQuizService.php` — quiz delivery (without answer keys), attempt submission, auto-grading, instructor grading, max-attempts enforcement.
- `app/Services/CourseCertificateService.php` — idempotent certificate issuance with a unique `CRS-*` serial, printable HTML generation.
- `app/Services/CoursePrerequisiteService.php` — prerequisite course resolution and per-learner completion state.
- `app/Services/CourseCohortService.php` — cohort CRUD for cohort-paced delivery.
- `app/Services/CourseNotificationService.php` — enrolment and completion notifications (in-app + email), locale-wrapped per recipient.
- `app/Services/CourseInstructorService.php` — instructor capability grants.
- `app/Services/CourseDiscussionService.php` — per-lesson discussion threads.
- `app/Services/CourseCategoryService.php` — category CRUD for catalogue taxonomy.
- `app/Services/CourseGroupService.php` — group-to-course link management.

Models and tables:

| Model | Table |

Migrations: `database/migrations/2026_05_29_000001_create_courses_core_tables.php` through `…000004_create_course_social_tables.php`, plus `2026_06_05_000000_add_course_certificate_unique_index.php`.

## Course content structure

A course has the following hierarchy:

```
Course
  └── CourseSection (ordered by position)
        └── CourseLesson (ordered by position)
              └── CourseQuiz (optional; one per lesson or standalone)
                    └── CourseQuestion (mcq / multi / truefalse / short / essay)
```

A lesson can be one of five content types: `video`, `text`, `pdf`, `embed`, or `quiz`. The `body` field carries rich text; `video_url`, `attachment_url`, and `embed_url` carry media links (validated as http/https URLs). Section assignment is optional — lessons belong to a course with or without an enclosing section, and `CourseContentController` verifies that a supplied `section_id` belongs to the same course before saving it.

## Visibility and authoring rules

### Catalogue visibility

The `visibility` enum has three values:

| Value | Who can see it |
| --- | --- |
| `public` | Anyone including anonymous visitors |
| `members` | Authenticated members only |
| `group` | Members of a group linked to the course via `course_group_links` |

A course is only surfaced in browse results and reachable via `show` when `status = published` AND `moderation_status = approved`. Instructors and admins can see their own draft/pending courses regardless of status through `canManageCourseAsUser()`.

Attempting to view a course outside the caller's audience returns a `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` (HTTP 404) to avoid leaking course existence.

### Who can author

By default (`courses.allow_member_authoring = true`) any authenticated member may create a course. A tenant may restrict authoring to explicit instructor grants plus admins by setting that option to `false`. Either way, **editing, publishing, or deleting** a course is restricted to its original author or an admin.

### Publication and moderation

New courses are created as `status=draft, moderation_status=pending`. `CourseService::publish()` sets `status=published`. If `courses.moderation_enabled` is `true` for the tenant, the course stays at `moderation_status=pending` until an admin calls the moderation endpoint. If moderation is disabled, the first publish auto-approves the course and stamps `published_at`.

On first approval, `CourseService::publish()` posts a feed activity for the author (guarded so a feed failure never blocks publishing).

### Instructor grants

When `courses.allow_member_authoring = false`, a member must be granted the instructor capability by an admin via `POST /v2/admin/courses/instructors`. Grants are idempotent (one row per tenant+user in `course_instructors`). Revocation deletes the row. Admin users bypass the grant check regardless of this setting.

## Enrolment lifecycle

```
Not enrolled
     │
     ▼  POST /v2/courses/{id}/enroll
  active  ─── (all lessons completed) ──▶  completed
     │
     ▼  DELETE /v2/courses/{id}/enroll
  dropped ─── (re-enrol) ──▶ active  (no second charge)
```

**Idempotency:** `CourseEnrollmentService::enroll()` returns the existing enrollment row when a learner re-enrols while already `active` or `completed`. The unique index `(tenant_id, course_id, user_id)` on `course_enrollments` enforces one row per learner+course at the database layer.

**Prerequisites:** before enrolment proceeds, `CoursePrerequisiteService::unmetIds()` checks that the learner has a `completed` enrollment in every course listed in the `courses.prerequisites` JSON array. Unmet prerequisites return `PREREQUISITES_NOT_MET` (HTTP 422).

**Cohort assignment:** an optional `cohort_id` may be supplied at enrolment. The service validates that it belongs to the same course before accepting it, preventing roster pollution from an arbitrary or cross-course cohort id.

## Paid enrolment & credit flow

When `credit_cost > 0`, calling `POST /v2/courses/{id}/enroll` triggers `CourseEnrollmentService::enrollWithPayment()`:

1. The course row is re-read inside a `DB::transaction` with `lockForUpdate()` so `credit_cost` and `author_user_id` are the freshest values, not a stale cached instance.
2. `CourseCreditService::chargeEnrollment()` calls `WalletService::transfer()` to move `credit_cost` credits from the learner to the course author.
3. If the charge succeeds, `enrollment.credits_paid` is updated and the enrollment is saved.
4. If the charge fails (insufficient credits, inactive author, etc.) a `RuntimeException` is thrown, the transaction rolls back (no enrollment row is created), and the controller returns `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` (HTTP 422).

Special cases:

- **Zero cost:** `credit_cost = 0` is treated as free — no transfer is made.
- **Author self-enrolment:** a user enrolling in their own course is never charged regardless of `credit_cost`.
- **Re-enrolment after dropping:** a dropped learner has already paid once. `enrollWithPayment()` detects the `dropped` row and calls the free `enroll()` path, preserving the "charge exactly once" contract.
- **Double-submit:** the outer idempotency check (`isEnrolled` short-circuit in the controller) catches a concurrent second call before the transaction runs.

The transfer uses `WalletService`'s row-locked, atomic path. See [docs/modules/wallet-exchanges.md](wallet-exchanges.md) for the full ledger invariants.

## Lesson progress and drip scheduling

`CourseProgressService::completeLesson()` calls `CourseLessonProgress::updateOrCreate()` (idempotent), then recomputes `enrollment.progress_percent` as `(completed_lessons / total_lessons) * 100`. When the ratio reaches 100%, the enrollment transitions to `completed` and `onCourseCompleted()` fires.

**Drip scheduling** (`drip_type` on `course_lessons`):

| Value | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | Lesson available immediately (default). |
| `days_after_enroll` | Unlocks `drip_offset_days` days after the learner's `enrolled_at`. |
| `fixed_date` | Unlocks on `drip_date` regardless of when the learner enrolled. |

`CourseLessonService::availability()` computes the `{available: bool, unlock_at: ?ISO8601}` response. A locked lesson returns `LESSON_LOCKED` (HTTP 403) if the learner tries to mark it complete.

## Quizzes

**Question types:**

| Type | Auto-graded? |
| --- | --- |
| `mcq` (single-answer) | Yes |
| `multi` (multi-select) | Yes |
| `truefalse` | Yes |
| `short` | No — enters `pending_review` queue |
| `essay` | No — enters `pending_review` queue |

`CourseQuizService::forLearner()` strips `correct` and `explanation` fields before delivering questions to the learner, so answer keys are never exposed client-side. `CourseQuestion.$hidden` enforces this at the model layer as well.

**Attempt limits:** `course_quizzes.max_attempts` (0 = unlimited). The service locks the enrollment row inside a `DB::transaction` before checking and recording the attempt count, preventing a race between two concurrent submission requests from the same learner. Exceeding the limit throws `MaxAttemptsExceededException`.

**Auto-grading:** for objective questions, `isCorrect()` compares sorted arrays of answer ids (handling both MCQ and multi-select), awards the question's `points` value, and computes `score_percent`. A quiz is `passed = true` when `score_percent >= pass_mark_percent` AND no subjective questions are present (a quiz with any `short`/`essay` question gets `grading_status = pending_review` and `passed = false` until manually graded).

**Instructor grading queue:** `GET /v2/courses/{courseId}/grading` returns attempts at `grading_status = pending_review`, including question prompts and the learner's answers but never the answer key. `POST /v2/courses/attempts/{attemptId}/grade` applies an instructor score and sets `grading_status = graded`.

## Course completion side effects

When the last lesson is marked complete, `CourseProgressService::onCourseCompleted()` fires the following — each step is individually `try/catch`-guarded so a failure in one never blocks the learner's progression record:

1. Increments `courses.completion_count`.
2. Issues (or returns the existing) completion certificate via `CourseCertificateService::issue()`.
3. Sends a completion notification + email to the learner in their `preferred_language` via `CourseNotificationService::completed()`.
4. Awards 50 XP and the `course_graduate` badge via `GamificationService`.

## Certificates

Certificates are issued by `CourseCertificateService::issue()`, which is idempotent (one certificate per `(tenant_id, course_id, user_id)` enforced by a unique index). The serial format is `CRS-` followed by 12 random upper-case alphanumeric characters.

`GET /v2/courses/{id}/certificate` returns both the `certificate` record (serial, `issued_at`) and a self-contained `html` string — an inline-styled HTML document suitable for browser printing to PDF. All human-readable strings in the HTML are rendered via `__('emails_misc.course_certificate.*')` keys, so they honour the active locale.

## Learner reviews

Enrolled and completed learners may leave one review per course (`POST /v2/courses/{id}/reviews`). Dropped learners cannot review. Each submission uses `updateOrCreate` so a learner can update their review. After each upsert, `CourseEnrollmentController::recomputeCourseRating()` recalculates `rating_avg` and `rating_count` on the `courses` row from all `status=approved` reviews.

## Per-lesson discussions

`course_discussions` carries threaded posts (via `parent_id`) attached to a lesson within a course. Admins may hide individual posts via `POST /v2/admin/courses/discussions/{id}/hide`. Authors can delete their own posts; admins can delete any.

## Admin surfaces

| Endpoint | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /v2/admin/courses` | List all courses (filterable by `moderation_status`). |
| `POST /v2/admin/courses/{id}/moderate` | Approve / reject / flag a course. Rejecting forces `status=draft`. |
| `GET /v2/admin/courses/analytics` | Tenant-level totals (published courses, pending, enrollments, completions, instructors). |
| `GET /v2/admin/courses/instructors` | List all instructor grants. |
| `POST /v2/admin/courses/instructors` | Grant instructor capability to a user. |
| `DELETE /v2/admin/courses/instructors/{userId}` | Revoke instructor capability. |
| `POST /v2/admin/courses/categories` | Create a category. |
| `PUT /v2/admin/courses/categories/{id}` | Update a category. |
| `DELETE /v2/admin/courses/categories/{id}` | Delete a category. |
| `POST /v2/admin/courses/discussions/{id}/hide` | Moderate a discussion post. |

Per-course analytics (`GET /v2/courses/{id}/analytics`, owner or admin only) includes enrollment counts by status, completion rate, average progress, average quiz score, and a per-lesson drop-off curve.

## Security & privacy invariants

- The `courses` feature must be enabled before any Courses endpoint runs — checked via `ensureCoursesFeature()`.
- `author_user_id`, `status`, `moderation_status`, and `published_at` are **not mass-assignable** on the `Course` model. They are set explicitly by the service layer to prevent authorship spoofing, self-publishing, or moderation bypass.
- Course visibility is enforced before returning any course data; private, draft, rejected, or group-only courses return 404 to callers outside the intended audience.
- Quiz answer keys (`correct`, `explanation`) are not present in `forLearner()` output. `CourseQuestion.$hidden` is a second layer of protection.
- The paid enrolment transaction (charge + row creation) runs inside a single `DB::transaction` with the course row locked, so no enrollment is created unless the credit movement commits.
- Every `UPDATE`/`DELETE` on `course_enrollments`, `course_lesson_progress`, and `course_quiz_attempts` must reference the correct `enrollment_id` or `user_id` — avoid bypassing tenant scope on these tables.
- Discussion moderation (hide) requires admin access; delete requires either authorship or admin access.

## Failure modes & recovery

| Failure | How it is handled |
| --- | --- |
| **Feature disabled** | All endpoints return HTTP 403 `FEATURE_DISABLED`. |
| **Insufficient credits** (paid enrolment) | `WalletService::transfer()` throws inside the DB transaction; the transaction rolls back; no enrollment row is created; controller returns HTTP 422 `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`. |
| **Author self-enrolment** | `CourseCreditService` skips the charge and returns `charged=false`; enrolment proceeds free. |
| **Dropped learner re-enrolls** | Detected before the charge; the existing `dropped` row is reactivated without a second credit transfer. |
| **Concurrent double-enrolment** | Unique index `(tenant_id, course_id, user_id)` on `course_enrollments` rejects the duplicate; `enrollWithPayment()` returns the existing row. |
| **Quiz max-attempts exceeded** | The attempt count is checked inside a row-locked transaction to prevent races; throws `MaxAttemptsExceededException`. |
| **Concurrent quiz submission** | The enrollment row is locked inside the `DB::transaction` for the attempt; only one write wins. |
| **Certificate issuance race** | Idempotency: the unique index rejects the duplicate and `issue()` fetches and returns the winning row. |
| **Feed post failure on publish** | Wrapped in `try/catch`; logs a warning; publish is not blocked. |
| **Notification / email failure** | Wrapped in `try/catch` throughout; logged; never blocks enrolment, completion, or publish. |
| **Gamification failure on completion** | Guarded individually; a GamificationService outage does not prevent the enrollment from reaching `completed`. |
| **Lesson drip gate** | A learner trying to complete a locked lesson receives HTTP 403 `LESSON_LOCKED`. The unlock time is included in the `progress` response (`availability[].unlock_at`). |
| **Section id from another course** | `CourseLessonService` validates the `section_id` belongs to the same course and silently sets it to `null` if not. |
| **Moderation pending** | A published course stays invisible in the public catalogue (no 404, just not returned by `browse`) until `moderation_status = approved`. The instructor can still view it via `GET /v2/courses/mine`. |
