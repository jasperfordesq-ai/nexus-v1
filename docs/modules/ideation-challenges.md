# Ideation & Challenges Module

Audience: maintainers and contributors working on community idea management, challenge lifecycles, voting, outcomes, or campaign organisation.

---

## What it does

The Ideation & Challenges module lets tenants run structured idea-collection campaigns:

- **Admins** create *challenges* — community problem statements with a lifecycle, deadlines, optional categories, tags, and a prize description.
- **Members** submit ideas in response to a challenge, vote on each other's ideas, comment, and save drafts.
- **Admins** progress challenges through a controlled lifecycle, shortlist and select winning ideas, and record outcomes (implementation status and impact).
- **Campaigns** group related challenges into a themed collection.
- **Templates** allow admins to pre-configure recurring challenge patterns.
- Winning ideas can be **converted into groups** (implementation teams) with a dedicated chatroom, task board, and document store.

> **Not to be confused with Gamification Challenges.** The `challenges` table and `ChallengeService` power time-bound XP/badge rewards on the gamification track (`GET /v2/gamification/challenges`). Ideation challenges use the `ideation_challenges` table and `IdeationChallengeService`. The two systems are fully independent — they share only the word "challenge".

---

## Feature gate

Feature flag: `ideation_challenges` (default: **ON**).

- PHP: `TenantContext::hasFeature('ideation_challenges')` — checked in `IdeationChallengesController::ensureFeature()` before every action. Returns HTTP 403 when the feature is disabled.
- React: all ideation routes are wrapped in `<FeatureGate feature="ideation_challenges">`. When disabled, the browse page shows a coming-soon placeholder; deeper routes redirect to `/`.
- Accessible (GOV.UK) frontend: gated in `AlphaController` using the same `TenantContext::hasFeature()` check (see `app/Http/Controllers/GovukAlpha/Concerns/IdeationParity.php`).
- Default value declared in `app/Services/TenantFeatureConfig.php`.

---

## Challenge lifecycle

Status transitions are validated server-side. Only admins can advance status.

```
draft → open → voting → evaluating → closed → archived
                └──────── evaluating → closed ──────────────┘
                          closed → open   (re-open)
```

Allowed transitions are enforced by `IdeationChallengeService::updateChallengeStatus()`. Attempting an invalid transition returns HTTP 409.

**Idea statuses** (admin-controlled via `updateIdeaStatus()`): `submitted → shortlisted → winner → withdrawn`.

---

## Database tables

All ideation tables are prefixed with `challenge_` or `ideation_`; they carry no cross-tenant data.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ideation_challenges` | Root challenge records; holds `tenant_id`, lifecycle `status`, deadlines, tags (JSON), `ideas_count`, `favorites_count`, `views_count`, `is_featured` |
| `challenge_ideas` | Idea submissions; `challenge_id` FK; `status` (`draft`, `submitted`, `shortlisted`, `winner`, `withdrawn`); `votes_count`, `comments_count` |
| `challenge_idea_votes` | One row per `(idea_id, user_id)` pair — toggled atomically |
| `challenge_idea_comments` | Comments on ideas |
| `challenge_favorites` | User bookmarks on challenges |
| `challenge_categories` | Tenant-scoped taxonomy for classifying challenges; has `slug`, `icon`, `color`, `sort_order` |
| `challenge_tags` | Reusable tags; linked via `challenge_tag_links` |
| `challenge_tag_links` | Many-to-many join between `challenge_tags` and `ideation_challenges` |
| `challenge_templates` | Admin-created templates with pre-filled fields; `default_tags` + `evaluation_criteria` stored as JSON |
| `challenge_outcomes` | One outcome per challenge; tracks `winning_idea_id`, implementation `status` (`not_started`, `in_progress`, `implemented`, `abandoned`), and `impact_description` |
| `idea_media` | Files or URLs attached to ideas |
| `idea_team_links` | Links a converted idea to its implementation group |
| `campaigns` | Thematic collections of challenges |
| `campaign_challenges` | Many-to-many join with `sort_order` |
| `group_chatrooms` | Chatrooms attached to implementation groups |
| `group_chatroom_messages` | Messages inside chatrooms; supports pinning |
| `team_tasks` | Kanban tasks inside implementation groups |
| `team_documents` | File uploads inside implementation groups |

Tenant scoping: `ideation_challenges.tenant_id` is the root anchor. Ideas, votes, and comments are scoped transitively by joining through their parent challenge. Categories, tags, templates, and outcomes carry their own `tenant_id` via the `HasTenantScope` trait on the relevant Eloquent models.

## Security and privacy invariants

- Every query on `ideation_challenges` includes `WHERE tenant_id = ?` (checked in `IdeationChallengeService` via `TenantContext::getId()`). Ideas, votes, and comments are scoped transitively by joining back to the parent challenge.
- Voting: users cannot vote on their own ideas; votes are rejected if the challenge is not in `open` or `voting` status; a duplicate vote toggles the existing vote off (idempotent toggle).
- Challenge update and delete are admin-only. Idea edit is owner-only and blocked once the challenge leaves `open` status.
- Draft ideas are owner-private: `getUserDrafts()` always filters by both `challenge_id` and `user_id`.
- Outcome upsert (including selecting a winning idea) is admin-only. The winning idea's membership in the challenge is validated before the FK is written.
- Duplicate operation creates a `draft` with zeroed counters; deadlines are intentionally cleared.
- All notification emails are rendered inside `LocaleContext::withLocale($recipient, ...)` so they go out in the recipient's `preferred_language`, not the caller's locale.

---

## Notifications

`IdeationChallengeService` fires in-app notifications and push (via `NotificationDispatcher::fanOutPush`) and templated HTML email (via `EmailDispatchService::sendRaw`) for:

| Trigger | Recipient |
|---|---|
| New idea submitted to a challenge | Challenge creator |
| Vote cast on an idea | Idea author (not on unvote) |
| Comment added to an idea | Idea author |
| Idea status changed by admin | Idea author |

Email templates use `lang/en/emails_ideation.json` (plus 10 locale variants).

---

## Prerender invalidation

`app/Observers/IdeationChallengePrerenderObserver.php` — registered as an Eloquent observer on `IdeationChallenge`. On model save or delete it marks `/ideation` and `/ideation/{id}` for cache invalidation via `PrerenderService`.

---

Key coverage:

- `IdeationChallengesControllerTest` — HTTP-level feature tests for challenge CRUD, idea submission, voting, and auth guards using `DatabaseTransactions`.
- `IdeationChallengeServiceTest` — unit tests with mocked DB; covers pagination shape, vote toggle, and draft publish path.
- `ChallengeOutcomeServiceTest` — outcome upsert and dashboard aggregation.
- `IdeationParityTest` — GOV.UK accessible-frontend route integration tests.
- React page/component tests: `IdeationPage.test.tsx`, `ChallengeDetailPage.test.tsx`, `IdeaDetailPage.test.tsx`, `CreateChallengePage.test.tsx`, `IdeationAdmin.test.tsx`, and the team sub-components.

## Failure modes and recovery

| Failure | Behaviour | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Feature disabled for tenant | All API endpoints return HTTP 403 (`FEATURE_DISABLED`); React routes show a coming-soon page | Enable `ideation_challenges` in tenant settings via the admin panel |
| Invalid status transition | `updateChallengeStatus()` returns `CONFLICT` error; HTTP 409 | Advance through the correct sequence (e.g. `open → voting` before `voting → evaluating`) |
| Vote on closed/evaluating challenge | `voteIdea()` returns `CONFLICT` (`challenge_voting_not_allowed`) | No action needed; the challenge must be `open` or `voting` to accept votes |
| Idea edit after challenge leaves `open` | `updateIdea()` returns `CONFLICT` (`challenge_closed_for_edits`) | Reopen the challenge status (admin) or use the admin idea-status endpoint to set the idea `withdrawn` |
| Notification email failure | `EmailDispatchService::sendRaw()` returns false; logged as `Log::warning` — the primary action still succeeds | Check `email_logs` table or SendGrid Activity for delivery status |
| Outcome `winning_idea_id` FK violation | Service validates that the idea belongs to the challenge; returns `VALIDATION_INVALID_VALUE` | Pass a valid idea ID that was submitted to the same challenge |
| Team conversion on non-shortlisted idea | `IdeaTeamConversionService` checks idea eligibility; returns `FORBIDDEN` or `CONFLICT` | Shortlist or mark the idea as winner before converting |
| Category deleted while challenges reference it | `ChallengeCategoryService::delete()` nulls out `category_id` on affected challenges before deleting the category row | No recovery needed; challenges retain their free-text `category` field |
