# Module Guide Map

Last reviewed: 2026-07-14

This page maps every live product module and cross-cutting client surface to its primary code and maintained documentation. It is a navigation aid, not a replacement for source code.

> Maintained module guides live under `docs/modules/`. The **source code** (`app/Services/`, `routes/api.php`) and machine-readable API contract remain authoritative. Federation, mobile, and the accessible frontend are cross-cutting surfaces with dedicated reference suites rather than duplicate module guides. The earlier per-module engine-report snapshots (dated 2026-03-29) were removed from the public repo because they had drifted from current behaviour; do not treat archived copies as live reference.

## Writing A Module Guide

Create a module guide only when it will help future maintenance. A good guide includes:

- audience and supported workflows;
- tenant and feature-gate rules;
- key routes, controllers, services, models, tables, and frontend entry points;
- security and privacy invariants;
- test commands and important regression tests;
- operational failure modes and recovery steps;
- OpenAPI links instead of copied endpoint tables.

Keep module guides small. Split only when one page becomes difficult to scan.
