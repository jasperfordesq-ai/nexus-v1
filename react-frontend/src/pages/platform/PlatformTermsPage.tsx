          operated communities (known as "tenants"), enabling them to coordinate
          timebanking, volunteering, and other forms of community exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          By accessing, browsing, or using any community powered by the Project
          NEXUS platform — whether as a Member, Operator, or casual visitor — you
          acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by
          these Platform Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree with
          these Terms, you must discontinue use of the Platform immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Terms govern the relationship between you and the Platform
          provider. They <strong>supplement</strong> — but do not replace — any
          terms, policies, or agreements established by your Community Operator.
          Your Community Operator may impose additional obligations or
          restrictions beyond those set out here.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of a conflict between these Platform Terms and any terms
          established by your Community Operator, these Platform Terms shall
          prevail with respect to platform-level matters (such as acceptable use
          of the infrastructure, limitation of liability of the Platform
          provider, and intellectual property). For community-level matters (such
          as membership criteria, exchange rules, and local policies), the
          Operator's terms apply.

        <p>
          Operators must ensure compliance with all laws and regulations

            Community policies
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data protection compliance</strong> — fulfilling all
            obligations under applicable data protection legislation (including
            GDPR, CCPA, and equivalent frameworks), acting as the data
            controller for Member personal data

          The Platform Provider reserves the right to modify, amend, or replace
          these Terms at any time. When changes are made, the effective date at
          the top of this document will be updated accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <strong>material changes</strong> — those that substantively alter
          your rights or obligations — the Platform Provider will make reasonable
          efforts to provide advance notice through the Platform, such as a
          banner notification, an update to the version history page, or
          notification to Community Operators.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your continued use of the Platform after the effective date of any
          revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to the
          updated Terms. If you do not agree with the revised Terms, you must
          discontinue use of the Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically to ensure
          you are aware of any changes. The effective date at the top of this
          document indicates when these Terms were last updated.

        <p>
          These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection
          with them (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be
          governed by and construed in accordance with the <strong>laws of
          Ireland</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any dispute arising under or in relation to these Terms shall be
          subject to the <strong>exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
          Ireland</strong>. You irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of those
          courts and waive any objection to proceedings in such courts on the
          grounds of venue or on the grounds that the proceedings have been
          brought in an inconvenient forum.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent
          jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision
          shall be severed from these Terms, and the remaining provisions shall
          continue in full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be
          modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and
          enforceable while preserving its original intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The failure of the Platform Provider to enforce any right or provision
          of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that right or
          provision.
