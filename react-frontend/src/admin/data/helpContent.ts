    steps: [

      { label: 'Set the cost-offset multiplier', detail: 'This multiplier adjusts the coefficient-weighted hours to account for administration, volunteer coordination, and overhead. Default is 0.8.' },
      { label: 'Configure exchange limits', detail: 'Set maximum single-exchange duration (e.g. 8 hours) and minimum (e.g. 15 minutes). Exchanges outside these limits require coordinator approval.' },
