# Third-Party Notices

Project NEXUS is licensed under **AGPL-3.0-or-later** (see [LICENSE](LICENSE) and
[NOTICE](NOTICE)). It also bundles third-party open-source components, each of which
remains under **its own** licence and copyright. This file records those components
and satisfies the "retain the copyright notice and licence text on redistribution"
condition of their permissive (BSD / MIT / Apache / ISC) licences.

- The **full, machine-generated production inventory** (every npm + Composer
  dependency, version, licence, source URL) is in
  [THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md).
- Regenerate and re-audit with: `node scripts/check-licenses.mjs --write`
  (or `npm run check:licenses`). The audit **fails** if a new strong-copyleft
  (GPL/AGPL/SSPL) dependency is introduced.

## Production dependency licence summary

| Ecosystem | Packages | Licence spread |
|---|---|---|
| npm (browser frontend) | ~362 | MIT (302), Apache-2.0 (29), ISC (15), BSD-3 (5), BSD-2 (2), 0BSD/Unlicense, `MIT AND Zlib`; `MPL-2.0 OR Apache-2.0` (DOMPurify → elect Apache-2.0); Hippocratic-2.1 (react-leaflet) |
| Composer (PHP backend) | 117 | MIT-dominant, plus BSD-3 / Apache-2.0 / BSD-2 / ISC and the dual/tri-licensed items noted below |

**No pure GPL/AGPL licence appears in either tree.** The Composer tree is fully
permissive after removing `rubix/ml` (an optional, `class_exists`-guarded
accelerator that transitively pulled `wamania/php-stemmer` → `joomla/string`, GPL-2.0).

## Licence elections and notes

Where a dependency offers a choice of licences ("A OR B"), Project NEXUS elects the
permissive option:

- **DOMPurify** — `MPL-2.0 OR Apache-2.0` → **Apache-2.0**.
- **nette/schema**, **nette/utils** — `BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0 OR GPL-3.0` → **BSD-3-Clause**.
- **james-heinrich/getid3** — `GPL-1.0-or-later OR LGPL-3.0-only OR MPL-2.0` → **MPL-2.0**
  (weak/file-level copyleft; usable in proprietary distributions with file-level obligations).
- **react-leaflet / @react-leaflet/core** — Hippocratic-2.1 is an *ethical-source* licence
  with a "no human-rights violations" field-of-use restriction; it is not copyleft. The
  underlying Leaflet library is BSD-2-Clause.

**No strong-copyleft (GPL/AGPL) dependency remains.** The previously-tracked
`joomla/string` (GPL-2.0-or-later) was removed by dropping `rubix/ml` — an optional
ML accelerator that was only ever used behind a `class_exists()` guard with a
pure-PHP fallback, so removing it is behaviour-preserving. The audit gate
(`scripts/check-licenses.mjs`, `KNOWN_EXCEPTIONS = {}`) now fails on any *new*
strong-copyleft dependency.
