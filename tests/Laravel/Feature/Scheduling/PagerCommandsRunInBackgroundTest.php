/**
 * Scheduler-noise regression lock (Sentry issue 128022136).
 *
 * The four operational monitors below intentionally `return self::FAILURE`
 * (exit non-zero) when they DETECT a problem — a signal for a human running
 * them by hand. But a *foreground* scheduled command with a non-zero exit makes
 * Laravel's ScheduleRunCommand throw "Scheduled command [...] failed with exit
 * code [1]" and report THAT to Sentry — a second, context-free error on top of
 * the command's own captureMessage alert. In production the GDPR pager fired
 * this daily (issue 128022136) for as long as a real overdue-DSAR backlog
 * existed. The fix is `->runInBackground()` on each: the vendor guard for that
 * throw is `if ($event->exitCode != 0 && ! $event->runInBackground)`, so a
 * backgrounded event never converts an intentional breach exit into a reported
 * failure, while the real alert and the manual-run exit code are preserved.
 *
 * If this test regresses, the scheduler-failure Sentry noise returns.
